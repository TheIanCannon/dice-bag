*Hello!*


_Dice Bag_

This is a simple app to roll virtual electronic dice for tabletop game players.

This app uses the same amounts and types of dice as the basic d4 to d20 set, with the addition of an extra d20 to handle two rolls at once (for advantage and disadvantage based rolls, multiple attacks, and the like).

The set also features a d100 to roll percentile on one die, instead of 2d10 where each is used respectively for a percentile and perdecile.


_Getting Started_

To use it, simply start up the index.html file, and click any of the 'dice' on screen. You will be given an instant result! Happy gaming!
